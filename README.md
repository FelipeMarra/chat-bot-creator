# Chatbot Creator Backend
> This is a backend project in python with  <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI<a> and <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy<a>. It was deployed in <a href="https://www.heroku.com/postgres">Heroku with the PostgreSQL add-on<a>. The objective was to create an API to a chatbot based on a state machine model, where the `creator user` can create chatbots and share it with `final users`. The chatbot is created using different types of states and transitions between them. There's even an `Open Text State` with some AI algorithms applied to it.

# Database Model
The database schema fully is presented in the images below and explained in detail along the next sections.

# Data Models
## Creator User Model
First things first, ower project needs a user. The `USER_CREATOR` model has an `ID`, a `name`, an `email` and `password`. The primary key is autoincremented for all models, for the user it could be the email, but it it would be bad for certain use cases like link generation - as we'll see later, the user's ID is used when generating a link to share the Chatbot.

The model is named as `Creator` User, because this the user that creates the Chatbots. The user that uses it it`s called Final User.

## Chatbot Model
This class that's gona base the role system. The `CHAT_BOT` model has an `ID`, a `name`, a list of `states` a `initial_state`, a `share_link`, and the id of the `cretor` user.

The chat `name` is unique for a user. In the table names that are equal are allowed, because different users can create a chatbot with the same name, so the column is not setted as unique, but tryning to create two with the same name for the same user returns an `HTTP_406_NOT_ACCEPTABLE` exception.

The list of `states` is a relation with the table responsable for the base state, and `initial_state` is the first state the state machine will run. 

The `share_link` is generated automaticaly fllowing the pattern: CHATBOT_BASE_URL/creator_user.id/chatbot_name, where CHATBOT_BASE_URL is the path to the API endpoint.
