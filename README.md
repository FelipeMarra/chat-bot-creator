# Chatbot Creator Backend
> This is a backend project in python with  <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI<a> and <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy<a>. It was deployed in <a href="https://www.heroku.com/postgres">Heroku with the PostgreSQL add-on<a>. The objective was to create an API to a chatbot based on a state machine model, where the `creator user` can create chatbots and share it with `final users`. The chatbot is created using different types of states and transitions between them. There's even an `Open Text State` with some AI algorithms applied to it.

FastAPI already generates a documentation of the API routes based on the Pydantic models defined inside the project. For that reason the doc below will focous on explaining the system in general, mainly in the data structure, so one can make correct use of the routes.

# Database Model
The database schema fully is presented in the images below and explained in detail along the next sections.

## Entityâ€“relationship Model

# Data Models
## Creator User Model
First things first, our project needs a user. The `USER_CREATOR` model has an `ID`, a `name`, an `email` and `password`. The primary key is autoincremented for all models, for the user it could be the email, but it it would be bad for certain use cases like link generation - as we'll see later, the user's ID is used when generating a link to share the Chatbot.

The model is named as `Creator` User, because this is the user that creates the Chatbots. The user that uses it it`s called Final User.

### Login
The login route asks for a `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` and returns user's info such as `name`, `email`, `id`, and also token data like `access_token`, `token_type`, and `expires_in`. When accessing the route `/creator_user/current` it will make use of the `oauth2_scheme` to identify the current user. This mean that if you use a midlewear, in the lib you use to make you requests, to inject the `oauth2_scheme` into the request, a empty call to this rout already retruns the user back to you.

In `Flutter` you might wanna use the packege `oauth_dio` to hadle those configurations if you're using `dio` to consume the API. 

## Chatbot Model
This is the class that's gona base the role system. The `CHAT_BOT` model has an `ID`, a `name`, a list of `states` a `initial_state`, a `share_link`, and the id of the `cretor` user.

The chat `name` is unique for a user. In the db table names that are equal are allowed, because different users can create a chatbot with the same name, so the column is not setted as unique, but tryning to create two with the same name for the same user returns an `HTTP_406_NOT_ACCEPTABLE` exception.

The list of `states` is a relation with the table responsable for the base state, and `initial_state` is the first state the state machine will run. 

The `share_link` is generated automaticaly fllowing the pattern: CHATBOT_BASE_URL/creator_user.id/chatbot_name, where CHATBOT_BASE_URL is the path to the API endpoint.
