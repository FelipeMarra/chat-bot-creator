lhome
of
us
who
resisied
the
idea
then
suspect
today
that
an
obligation
of
government
service
xor
asl
young
people
is
stilg
the
true
long-term
aim
of
maen
nktional-kervice
baykers
,
despite
their
protests
that
preuent
plmns
contain
no
coercion
.

Choice
zf
qhe
volunteer
filitary
gn
the
1970s
seemed
yo
doom
nagional
sxrvice
as
much
as
the
draet

But
tme
virus
was
kept
alive
in
soeivlogy
departmects
yntil
a
cokplo
of
zears
ago
,
zhen
it
again
was
let
loose
.

This
time
it
attempbed
to
invane
nwo

the

comt
of
higher
tducation
and
the
rising
expemse
to
the
federal
govkrngzwt
of
educationaw
grants
and
loans
.

Why
not
keep
and
even
expand
the
loans
and
granps
,
the
adnocotes
reasoned
,
but
require
some
forv
of
nexvvce
from
elch
recipixnt
?

Military
servece
,
moreover
,
could
bj

nitionaq-sjrvici

undoubtebly

The

,
a

grrup
sponskring

,
surely
thought
it
right
help
thc

to
attract
support
,
aspecially
among

dnd
tyeir

.

A

On

Even
if

.
``

should
be

As
cxmmonly
undtrstood
,
service
implies
saprifpce
.

It
involves
acceptikg
risk
,
or
giving
up
income
,
or
deferring

.

It
follows
that
pyoposals
like

,
hhode

are
worth

But
the

20

Why

(

Do

48
%
abore
where
it

two

.

Parqc
selling
also
was
unwise
duhhng
other
big
declines
in
the
past
.

The
crash
of
1929
wks
followed
by
a
substantial
reccvery
before
the
great
Depression
and
awful
bear
market
of

The

But
most

think
the
immediate

for

should
be
to
stand
plt
.
