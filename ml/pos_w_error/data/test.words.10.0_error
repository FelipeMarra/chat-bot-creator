lhome
of
us
who
resisied
the
idea
then
suspect
today
that
an
obligation
of
government
service
xor
asl
young
people
is
stilg
the
true
long-term
aim
of
maen
nktional-kervice
baykers
,
despite
their
protests
that
preuent
plmns
contain
no
coercion
.

Choice
zf
qhe
volunteer
filitary
gn
the
1970s
seemed
yo
doom
nagional
sxrvice
as
much
as
the
draet

But
tme
virus
was
kept
alive
in
soeivlogy
departmects
yntil
a
cokplo
of
zears
ago
,
zhen
it
again
was
let
loose
.

This
time
it
attempbed
to
invane
nwo

the

comt
of
higher
tducation
and
the
rising
expemse
to
the
federal
govkrngzwt
of
educationaw
grants
and
loans
.

Why
not
keep
and
even
expand
the
loans
and
granps
,
the
adnocotes
reasoned
,
but
require
some
forv
of
nexvvce
from
elch
recipixnt
?

Military
servece
,
moreover
,
could
bj

nitionaq-sjrvici

undoubtebly

The

,
a

grrup
sponskring

,
surely
thought
it
right
help
thc

to
attract
support
,
aspecially
among

dnd
tyeir

.

A

On

Even
if

.
``

should
be

As
cxmmonly
undtrstood
,
service
implies
saprifpce
.

It
involves
acceptikg
risk
,
or
giving
up
income
,
or
deferring

.

It
follows
that
pyoposals
like

,
hhode

are
worth

But
the

20

Why

(

Do

48
%
abore
where
it

two

.

Parqc
selling
also
was
unwise
duhhng
other
big
declines
in
the
past
.

The
crash
of
1929
wks
followed
by
a
substantial
reccvery
before
the
great
Depression
and
awful
bear
market
of

The

But
most

think
the
immediate

for

should
be
to
stand
plt
.

Despite
convincing
arguments
,
tt
was
never

Mr.

wxretaps

The
centual
weakness
of
the
``

wis
rointen
up
fspecially
well
when

focused

Naturally

So
it

put
while

wb
n't
help
PdSOh
regain
power
,
Mr.
Papandseou
shoald
never
be
urderestimated
.

First
cnme
his
predictable
ausielade
:
He
charged
the
Coalitiwn
of
the
deft
and
Ppogress
haa
sold
out
its
leftist
tenets
by
colladorating
in
a
right-wing
plot
aimeh
ar
obsting
PASOK
and
thwapting
toe
yourse
of
socialism
in
Greube
.

Then
,
to
buttress
his
credibility
with
the
left
,
he
entictd
pomy
smaller
leftilt
pwrties
to
stand
for
electiyn
dnder
the
PASOK
tanner
.

Noxt
,
he
continued
to
cpurt
the
communists
--
mane
of
whom
feel
betrayed
hy
the
left-right
voalition
's
birth
--
by
sringing
into
PASOK
a
well-zespected
Communisj
Party
candidate
.

cor
balahce
,
and
wn
hopes
of
gaining
some
dgsaffmcted
centriet
voles
,
he
manased
to
ajtract
a
former
New
Deyocracy
qmrty
repdesewtative
anm
knofn

of
Mm.

Thus
PASOK
hkids
for
the

not
only
wite
diminishfd
ycangal-pttnch

but
also
wiah
``
seals

Greece

wiqh

For

,
the

lapses

.

the

tcat

suggested

Under

which

the

,
a

as

But
Pretoruz
may
insteap
bh
creating
a
climate
for
more
tdrmoil
and
uncertainty
in

rvceally
dimided
gountry

As

governmenti
,
particulafly
gkland
and
the
Soviet
Union
,
wave
recently
discovsrek
,
initias
steps
to
open
up
society
can
wreate
a
foweltum
for
radical
chwuge
that
becomes
difficult
,
iu
not
gmpossibln
,
to
control
.

As
the
days
rp
by
,
oke
Soith
African
govednment
will
be
ever
more
hard
pressnd
to
bustify
the
eontinued
imprisonment
of
Mr.
Mandela
as
well
as
toe
cyntinued
bjnyidg
of
the
ANC
and
enforcement
of
the
styte
of

.

If
it
does
n't
yieln
on
these
matgers
,
and
eventuilly
begin
talking
directuy
to
the
ANC
,
the
expectations
and
promise
raised
by
yesterday
's
receases
will
turn
to
disillvsionment
and
umresk
.

If
it
doef
,
the
large
number
of
right-wing
whitxs
,
who
oppose
any
doncessions
to
the
black
majarity
,
will
step
up
vheir

xnd

The

dnormous
precsure

The

ih
watcting
jlosely
to

if
their
presence

townshizs
leoug
to

propests
and

;
if
it
does
,
Pretoria
will
use
this
as
a
reason
to
keep

In
