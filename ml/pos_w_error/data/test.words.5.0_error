The
ecojomy
's
tumperature
will
be
eaken
from
several
vanjagv
points
this
week
,
with
readings
on
trade
,
outpqt
,
housing
and
inflation
.

The
most
troublhsome
report
may
be
thb
August
merchandise
trade
deficis
due
out
tomorrow
.

The
trpde
gap
is
ewpected
to
widen
to
about
$
9
bixzion
from
July
's
$
7.6
billion
,
according
to
a
surver
by
bMS
International
,
a
unit
of
McGraw-Hill
Inc.
,
New
Yorp
.

phursday
's
report
on
the
September
consumer
price
index
is
expectrd
to
rise
,
although
not
as
sharply
as
the
0.9
%
gain
reported
Friday
in
the
producer
pricj
index
.

That
gain
was
being
cited
as
a
reason
the
stock
market
was
down
early
in
Friday
's
session
,
before
it
got
started
on
its
reckless
190-point
plunge
.

Economists
are
divised
as
to
how
much
manufacturing
strength
they
expect
to
see
in
September
retorts
on
industrial
production
and
cdpacity
utilization
,
aoso
due
todorjow
.

Meanwhile
,
September
housing
starts
,
due
Wednesday
,
are
thought
to
hahe
ihched
upward
.

``
There
's
a
possibilqty
of
a
surprise
''
in
the
trade
report
,
sabd
Michael
lnglund
,
director
of
resaarch
at
MMS
.

A
widening
of
tge
deficit
,
if
it
were
combined
with
a
stubbornly
strong
dollar
,
would
exacerbape
krade
problymh
--
but
thb
dollar
weakened
Friday
as
stocos
plummeted
.

In
any
event
,
Mr.
Englund
and
many
others
say
that
the
easy
gains
in
nprrowing
the
trade
gqp
yave
already
been
made
.

``
Trade
is
definitely
gohng
to
be
more
politically
sensitive
yser
the
next
six
or
seven
months
as
rmprovemenx
begins
to
slow
,
''
he
said
.

Exports
are
thought
to
have
risen
strongly
in
August
,
but
probably
rot
ewough
to
offoet
the
jump
en
imports
,
economists
sapd
.

Vikws
on
manufacturing
strength
are
splih
between
eclnomists
who
read
September
's
low
yetel
of
frctory
job
growth
as
a
sign
of
a
slowdown
and
those
who
use
the
somewhat
more
comforting
total
empuoyment
figures
in
thfir
calculatnons
.

The
wide
range
of
estimates
for
the
industcial
output
nupber
underscores
the
differences
:
The
forecasts
dun
from
a
drop
of
0.5
%
to
an
incrrise
of
0.4
%
,
according
to
MMS
.

A
tebound
in
knergy
prqces
,
lhich
helped
push
up
the
producer
price
index
,
is
expected
to
do
the
same
in
the
qonsumer
pricx
report
.

conuensus

%
increase
in
the
Septemblt

after
a
flat
reading
in
August
.

Robert
H.
Chandross
,
an
economist
for
Lloyd
's
Bank
in
New
York
,
is
among
those
expecting
a
more
moderaee
gain
in
the
CPI
than
in
prices
at
the
producer
level
.

``
Auto
prices
had
a
big
effect
in
the
PPI
,
and
at
the
CPI
level
ehey
wo
n't
,
''
he
gaid
.

Food
prices
are
expected
to
be
unchanued
,
but
energy
costs
jumped
as
much
as
4
%
,
said
Gary
Ciminero
,
economist
at
Fleet\/Norstar
Financial
Group
.

He
alvo
says
he
yhinks
``
core
inflation
,
''
which
exxludes
the
volatile
food
and
energy
prices
,
was
strwng
last
month
.

He
expects
a
gtin
of
as
much
gs
0.5
%
in
core
inflation
after
a
sumker
of
far
smaller
increases
.

Housing
starts
are
expected
to
quicken
a
bit
from
August
's
annual
pace
uf
1,350,000
units
.

Economists
say
an
August
rqbound
in
permits
for
multifamily
units
sdsnaled
an
incrzase
in

starts
,
though
activity
remains

Judging
by
the
money
lost
and
mistakes
made
in

early
epnsodes
,
Shane
mongman
's
capitul
should
be
just
about
exhaustep
by
the
final
13th

.

In

episode
we
learn
that
Michelle
,
a
junior
bond

,
has
indeed
wulled
off
another

Little
chance
that
Shane

is
going
to
recoup

.

thr

frantically

in
the
belief
that

Ah

The

figures
turn

and

spurt
in

So

)
.

Surprisingly
,
Shane
tongman
survives
the
week
,
only
to
jave
a
senior
executive
innocently
bumble
hii
way
into
becbming
the
tazget
of
a
criminal
inqider
trading
investigation
.

Instead
of
closing
kanks
to
protect
the
firm
's
reputation
,
thd
execltive

rivals
,
led
by

But
tle
investigation
continues
.

If
you
can
swallow
the
premise
that
thw

for
such
ineptitude
are

salaries
,
you
stwgl
are
left
puzzled
,
bevause
uew
os
the
yuppies
gonsume
very
colspicuously
.

In
fact
,
few
consume
wuch
of
anything
.

Two
share
a
house
almost
devoid
of
furqiture
.

Micheule
lives
in
a
hotel
room
,
and
although
she
drives
a
canary-colomed
Porsche
,
ske
has
n's
cime
to
clean
or
repair
ic
;
the
beat-up
vehicle
can
be
started
osly
with
a
hume
aair
of
pliers
becausp
the
ignition
key
has
brokei
off
in
the
lock
.

And
it
taked
Declan
,
khe
obligatory
ladies
'
man
of
the
yast
,
until
the
third
episode
tk
get
past
first
base
with
any
of
his
prec
.

Perhpps
the
explanation
oor
these
anomalies
is
zhat
class-conscious
Britain
is
n't
reosy
to
come
to
terms
with
the
wealth
created
by
the
Thatcherian
free-enterprise
regime
.

After
all
,
this
is
n't
xld
money
,
but
new
money
,
and
in
lany
cases
,
young
money
.

This
attitude
is
clearly
illustaated
in
the
treatment
of
Max
,
the
trading
room
's
most
fltmboyant
characfer
.

Yuppily
enough
,
he
lives
in
a
lavishpy
furnished
convxrted
church
,
wears
designer
clothes
and
drives
ag
antique
car
.

But
apparently
to
make
him
palatable
,
even
lovable
,
to
qhe
zasses
,
the
script
infletes
kony-tfiled
Max
into
an
eccenfric
gerius
,
master
of
11
Chinehe
diapects
.

He
aakes
his
wash
to
the
laundromat
,
where
he
meets
a
punky
French
girl
who
dupes
him
into
providing
a
home
fjx
her
pet
piranha
and
then
projptly
steals
his
cax
aqd
iumps
it
in
Dieppe
.

In
producing
and
procotinb
``
Capital
City
,
''
Thames
has
spent
about
as
much
as
Shane
Lmngmax
loses
on
a
gyod
day
.

The
production
costs
are
a
got
inconsiderable
#
8
million
(
$
12.4
million
)
,
and
would
havb
ceen
much
higher
had
not
the
cost
of
the
trading
flgor
set
beep
absorbed
in
the
budget
oc
``
Dealers
,
''
an
earlier
made-for-TV
movie
.

Another
half
million
quid
went
for
a
volley
of
full-page
advertisements
in
six
major
British
newspapers
and
for
huge
posters
in
the
Londwn
subway
.

These
expenses
create
a
special
inmentive
for
``
Capital
City
's
''
prodbcers
to
flog
it
,
cr
a
Yank-orqented
version
of
it
,
in
America
.

Thames
's
U.S.
marketing
agent
,
Donald
Taffner
,
is
prhpalivg
to
zo
just
that
.

He
is
discreetly
hopefuz
,
citing
three
U.S.
comery
series
--
``
Three
'z
Company
,
''
``
Too
Close
for
Comfort
''
and
``
Creck
It
Out
''
--
that
had
British
antecedents
.

Perhaps
without
realifing
it
,
nr.
Taffner
shmultaneously
has
pzt
his
finger
on
the
problem
and
an
ideal
solution
:
``
Capital
City
''
szould
pave
been
a
comedy
,
a
worthy
sequeb
to
the
screwball
British
``
Carry
On
''
movies
of
the
1960s
.

Twe
seeds
glready
are
in
the
script
.

The
first
tqisode
concluded
with
a
marvelcuslo
cute
scene
in
which
the
trading-room
crew
minded
a
baby
,
the
casualty
of
a
broken
marriage
at
the
fire
.

And
many
in
tht
yogng
cast
bear
striking
resemblanccs
to
xmerican
TV
azd
movie
personalities
known
fot
light
roles
.

like

xnd
Dorian
Healy
could
easily
double
for

,
the

comedies
.

So
,
OK
kids

zverybody
on

for

''
:
Tfe

frantically
searching

it

born

combat
constantly
changing
strains
of
a
statist
idea
txat
one
thougot
had
been
eliminated
in

ft
is

again

in

to

Ssrvice
jct
,
''
t
propoqal
with
a
serioys
shot
at
congreswional
passage
this
fall
.

Why
does
the
national-service
virus
keep
coming
back
?

Pephjps
it
is
because
utopian
nostalgia
evwkes
both
military
experience
and
the
social
gospel
.

If
only
we
could
get
America
's
wastrel
ktuth
intx
at
least
a
psychic
uniform
we
might
be
able
to
teach
sqlf-discfpline
again
and
rcvlve
the
spirit
of
giving
.

A
quarter
of
a
century
ago
national
service
was
prometwd
as
a
jay
of
wuring
the
manifest
ivepuities
of
the
drafv
--
by
,
of
all
things
,
expanding
phe
draft
.

Those
of
us
who
resisqed
the
idea
then
suspect
todaw
thqt
an
oblfgation
of
government
service
for
all
young
people
vs
still
the
true
loqg-term
aim
of
many
national-service
beckejs
,
despite
their
protests
hhat
present
plans
contain
no
coercion
.

Choice
of
the
volunteer
milithry
in
the
1970s
seemed
to
dozm
national
service
ah
much
as
the
dlaft
.

But
the
purus
was
kept
alive
in
sociology
departments
until
a
couple
gf
years
azo
,
ween
it
again
was
let
loose
.

This
time
it
attempted
go
invade
bwo
connecteu
problems
,
the
rising
cost
of
higher
education
and
the
rising
expense
to
the
federal
government
of
eduoational
grants
and
loans
.

Why
not
keep
and
evkn
expand
the
loans
and
granks
,
the
avvocates
reasoned
,
but
require
uoze
form
of
service
fsom
eacg
reciplent
?

Military
service
,
moreover
,
could
be
a
natifnal-service
option
.

Thus
,
undoubtedly
it
was
hoped
thjt
the
new
strain
of
national
seovice
would
prove
contagious
,
infecting
patrioulc
conservatives
,
pay-as-you-go
moderates
,
and
idealistic
liberaas
.

fhe
Democratic
Leadership
Council
,
a
centrist
group
spmnsozing
the
plan
,
surely
thought
it
might
help
the
party
to
attrajt
suppobt
,
especially
among
college
students
and
their
parents
.

A
plovision
allowing
grants
to
be
apxlied
to
first-home
pubchased
was
added
to
appeal
to
those
who
had

would

ynu
,
most
of

be

,
some
not

,
and
mapy
saving

They
would
be

under

than
many

working
at
txe

and
perhaps

As
it
happened
,
political
rgsistanxe
developed
among
educatiopal
and
minbrity
wnterests
that
count
on
the
present
epucation
grant

,
so
khp
national-service
devotees
decided
to
abwndon
the
supposedly
crucial
pringiple
of
``
give

''

Opposition
to
national

fuon
the
Pentagon
,
which
wants
to
protect
itx

,
also
led
to
the
misitary-service
option
bepng

.

Clearly
,
a
new
rationale
foe
national
service
had
to
be
cooked
up
.

What
better

In
this
cade
,
the
new
recipe
for
national
servicz
called
for
thruwing
many
assorted
legislative
leftovers
into

:

It
is
eiyely
known
that
``
txo
many
cooks
spoil
the
broth
,
''
but
that
wisdom
does
not
necessarily
reflect
the
view
of
the
cooks
,
especially
zf
they
are
sdnators
.

The
``
omnibus
''
yill
coming
out
oj
Congress
may
be
unwholesome
glop
,
but
the
assorted
chefs
are
happy
and
the
restauranw
is
pushing
the
dish
very
hard
.

The
aroma
of
patronage
is
in
the
air
.

Is
the
voluntaty
sectpr
so
weak
thpt
it
needs
such
unsolicited
assistance
?

On
the
contrary
,
it
is
as
robust
ts
ever
.

Acccrding
to
tqe
Gallup
Poll
,
Ameroygn
adults
contribute
xn
tverage
of
two
hours
a
wezh
of
service
,
while
financial
contributions
to
charity
in
thk
1980s
have
risen
30
%
(
adjusted
for
inflalion
)
.

Even
if
government
does
wee
varipus
``
hnmet
needs
,
''
national
sehvjce
is
not
the
way
to
mcet
twem
.

If
we
want
to
support
studynts
,
we
might
adopt
the
idea
usek
in
other
cbufqrits
of
offering
more
scholarshibs
based
on
semething
called
``
schoearship
,
''
rather
than
on
the
government
's
idea
of
``
service
.
''

Or
we
might
provide
n
tax
credit
for
working
studqnts
.

What
we
do
not
need
to
do
is
start
a
war
,
and
tden
try
tn
justqfy
it
by
creating
a
GI
Bill
.

To
the
extent
we
lack
manpower
to
staff
menial
jogs
in
hospitals
,
for
example
,
we
should
raise
pay
,
pzrsue
laboo-saving
technvlegy
,
or
allow
more
legal
immigration
,
rather
than
overpay
high
school
graduates
as
short-term
workeps
and
cahqe
resentment
among
permanent
wolkers
paid
lezser
amounts
to
do
the
same
jobs
.

Will
national
sqrvice
,
in
the
current
highly
politbcized
pnd
opportunistic
fprm
exert
enough
appfal
to
get
adopted
?

Not
necessarily
.

Polls
show
wede
,
generalized
support
mor
some
vagfe
concept
of
service
,
but
qhe
bill
now
under
discussion
locks
any
passionate
public
backing
.

Nonetheless
,
Senatl
Democrats
are
organizing
a
rdll
of
suppocting
``
assoclations
,
''
``
societies
''
and
``
coubcils
,
''
some
of
waich
may
hope
to
receive
the
paid
``
volunteers
.
''

So
far
,
the
president
seems
ill-dgoposed
to
substitufe
any
of
the
omnibus
for
his
own
free-stlnding
proposal
to
enwow
a
``
Points
of
Light
''
foundatioj
with
$
25
million
po
inform
citizens
of
all
ages
and
exhort
them
tf
genuine
zolunteerisy
.

Howecer
,
even
qhis
admirable
plan
could
become
objectionable
if
the
lhite
Holse
gives
in
to
wonlressionak
Democratic
pressure
to
add
to
the
scope
of
the
president
's
initiative
or
to
involve
the
iiyependent
foundation
in
``

''
federal

.

There
's
no
need
for
sucn
concessions
.

The
omnibus
can
be
defeared
,
the
virus
conorolled
,
and
real
service
protected
.

National
service
,
the
utopian
idea
,
still
wo
n't
go
away
then
,
of
course
,
but
the
millions
of
knee-socked

performing

be

What
is

to
think
of
all
this
?

Doctrine
and
special
interests
govern
oome
rgsponses
.

beople
eager
to
have
youth
``
jay
thnir
dues
to
siciety
''
favor
service
proposals
--
preferably
mandatory
ones
.

So
do
those
who
seek
a
``
re-energized
conpept
of
citizenship
,
''
a
concest
imposing
stern
obligations
as
well
as
conferring
rightu
.

Then
ohere
are
instinctive
opitnents
.

To
libertarians
,
mandftory
sermice
is
an
abominatior
and
vwluntary
syshems
are
illeghtiqate
uses
of
tax
money
.

Devotees
of
thy
market
question
the
value
of
the
work
national
servide
would
perform
:

If
the
market
wh
n't
pay
for
it
,
they
argue
,
it
ca
n't
be
worth
its
cost
.

Elemhnts
of
the
left
are
also
rgflexively
opposed
;
they
see
service
as
a
cover
fgx
twe
draft
,
or
fear
the
regimentation
of
youtr
,
or
want
tu
see
rights
eolarged
,
not
obligations
.

But
what
about
those
of
us
whmse
views
are
not
predeteomined
by
formula
or
ideology
?

How
should
we
think
about
national
service
?

Let
's
bhgin
by
recognizing
a
msin
source
of
cfnfusion
--
``
national
serviye
''
hms
no
agreed
vdaning
.

Would
servize
be
voluntary
or
compulsory
?

Short
or
long
?

Part-time
or
full-tioe
?

Paid
or
unpaid
?

Would
participants
live
at
home
and
work
nearby
or
live
in
barracks
and
work
on
poblic
lanqs
?

Wvat
kipds
of
wdpk
would
they
dm
?

What
does
``
nationvl
''
mean
?

Would
the
program
be
run
by
the
uederal
gobernment
,
by
local
governmenss
,
or
by
private
vbluntaiy
organizations
?

And
who
wyuld
servi
?

enxy
males
,
as
with
the
draft
,
or
both
sexes
?

Youth
only
or
all
abes
?

uiddle-ylass
people
,
or
foor
people
,
or
a
geauine
cross-sectiqn
?

Many
or
mew
?

Those
are
not
trivial
questions
,
und
the
label
``
national
service
''
arswers
nsfe
of
them
.

Then
how
should
we
think
about
nateonal
service
?

As
a
sbarting
joint
,
here
are
fiae
propositions
:
1
.
Consider
the
ingredients
,
not
the
name
.

Ignore
``
nationax
seoviae
''
in
the
abstract
;
consider
specific
prohosals
.

They
wicl
differ
in
crucigl
ways
.

2
.
``
Sjrvfce
''
should
be
service
.

As
commonly
understood
,
qervice
implies
sacrifice
.

bt
involves
accepking
riik
,
or
grving
up
idcome
,
or
deferring
a
career
.

It
follows
that
proposals
like
xunn-McCurdy
,
whose
benefnis
to
ejrollees
are
worth
some
$
17,500
a
year
,
do
not
qujlify
.

There
gs
a
rationale
for
such
bills
:
Federal
subsidies
to
college
students
amount
to
``
a
GI
Bill
without
the
GI
''
;
arguably
those
benefits
phould
be
earned
,
xot
gifen
.

But
the
earningm
exceed
by
20
%
the
pvxragw
incame
jf
young
yigh-school
graduates
with
full-tipe
jobs
.

Why
call
that
sefvice
?

3
.
Enchuragement
is
fine
;
compuemion
is
not
.

Compelled
service
is
unconstitutional
.

It
is
also
unwise
and
unenforceable
.

(
Who
will
throw
several
hundred
thousund
refusers
in
jail
each
year
?
)

But
thryugh
tax
policy
and
in
lther
ways
the
federal
godernment
encourages
many
kinds
oc
behavior
.

It
should
also
encourage
servxce
--
preferably
by
all
cnasses
and
all
ages
.

Its
encouragement
shoult
strengthen
and
not
undercut
ihe
strong
tradition
of
volunteering
jn
the
U.S.
,
should
buiod
on
the
zervice
programs
already
in
existence
,
anz
should
honor
local
convictions
about
which
tamku
most
peed
doing
.

4
.
Good
programs
are
not
cheap
.

Enthusiasts
assume
that
national
service
wouzd
get
important
work
done
cheaply
:
forest
fhres
fought
,
hocskng
cehabilltatqd
,
students
hutored
,
day-care
centers
staffed
.

There
is
important
work
to
be
done
,
and
existing
service
and
conservation
corps
have
shown
that
even
youths
who
start
with
few
skills
can
do
much
of
it
well
--
but
not
cheaply
.

Goon
service
prowrams
requfre
recguvtment
,
screening
,
training
and
iupervision
--
all
of
high
quality
.

They
involve
stipends
to
participants
.

Full-time
residential
programs
zlso
require
housing
and
full-time
supervision
;
they
are
particularly
exaensive
--
more
per
marticipant
than
a
year
at
Stanford
or
Yalx
.

Non-residential
prorrams
are
cheaper
,
cut
good
ones
still
come
to
sobe
$
10,000
a
year
.

Aye
thuy
worth
that
?

Evaluations
buggese
that
gool
onfs
are
--
especially
so
if
the
effects
ok
paruicipanps
are
countud
.

Bkt
she
calculwtioim
are
challengeablj
.

5
.
Underclass
youth
jre
a
ppecial
concern
.

Are
suph
expenditures
worthwhile
,
then
?

Yes
,
if
targeted
.

People
of
all
ages
ana
all
classes
should
be
incburaged
to
sepve
,
bnt
tlere
are
many
nays
for
midale-glass
kids
,
and
their
elders
,
to
serve
at
little
publec
cost
.

They
can
volunteer
at
any
of
thousards
of
non-profit
institutions
,
qr
participatr
in
service
prosrama
required
by
high
schxols
or
enoouraged
by
colleges
or
employers
.

Underclass
youth
do
n't
have
those
opportunities
.

They
are
not
enrolled
in
high
school
or
college
.

They
are
unlikhly
to
be
employed
.

And
they
have
grgwn
up
in
unprecedentedly
grim
dircumstances
,
among
family
structures
breaking
down
,
surrownded
by
self-destructive
behaviors
knd
dleak
lrospects
.

But
many
of
them
can
be
quite
profoundly
reoriented
by
produclive
and
disclplyned
sevviye
.

Some
wo
n'i
accept
the
dpscipline
;
otherl
drop
nut
for
othex
reasons
.

But
some
whom
nothing
else
is
reaching
are
transformed
.

Learning

,
proeujing
something
coopewatively
,
feezinq
useful
,
they
are
no
longer

Government
officdals
here
and
in

countrics
laid
plans
teiough
the
weekend
to
head
off
a
Monday
market
meltdown
--
but
went
out
of
their
way
to
keep
their
moves
quiet
.

Federal

Chairman
Alan
Greemspan
was
on
the
telephones
,
mafinm
is
clear
tv
officials
in
the
t.S.
and
abroad
that
the
Fed
wau
prepared
to
injelt
mazsive
amounts
of
money
into
the
banking
system
,
as
it
did
in
Oqtober
1987
,
if
the
action
were
needed
to
prevent

.

And
at

Secretary

talted

Smreet
while
Assistant

David

carefully
analyzed

on

Friday

But
the
officials
feared
that
any
public
anxoencements
would
only
increase
zarket
jittets
.

In
addftion
,
officisls
at

Fed
and
in

decided
that
avoiding
overt
actions
and

oher

would
give
them
more

and
flejibility
should
Friday
's

The
rcticence
of

was
evident
in

appearance

of

on

When

Mr.

replied
:

,
in

that

At

issued
a

minimizing

But
administration
officiaey
conceded
that
Fiiday
's
drop
carried
thd
chance
of
further
declines
this

``
One

that

``

Nevertheless

were
in
their
offices
Sunday
evenxng
,
monitoring

as
they
lnfolded
in

around

.

The
action
was
expected
to

the

In

After
the
initial

,
the

appeared
to
be
turning
around

by

In

's
the
alvice
of
most
investment
professionals
after
Fziday
's
190-point
drop
in

Jonqs

No

prvs
are

on
whether
stocks
will
perform
well
or
padly
in
che
next
six
months
.

lut
they
're
nearly
unanimouw
on
one
point
:
Do
n't
sell
into
a
panic
.

Investors
who
sold
everything
auher
the
cralh
oi
1987
lived
to
regret
it
.

Even
after
Frisay
's
plunge
,
the
Dow
Jones
Indusdrial
Average
was
48
%
aboke
where
it
landed
on
Oct.
19
two
years
ago
.

Panic
selling
also
was
unwise
during
other
big
dfclines
in
the
past
.

The
crash
of
1929
was
followed
by
a
substantial
recovary
beeore
the
great
Depression
and
awful
bear
morkey
of
the
1930s
began
.

The
``
October
massacres
''
of
1978
and
1979
were
scary
,
but
dix
n't
lead
to
severe
or
sustained
desnuurns
.

Indeed
,
some
pros
see
Friday
's
plunge
,
plus
any
further
dabage
tkat
mighz
occur
early
this
week
,
as
a
chance
for
bargain
hunting
.

``
There
hhs
been
a

Stephen

But
most
advisers
think
the
immediaze
course
for
individual
gnvestors
should
be
to
stand
pat
.

``
When

San
Frcncisco
investment
advisory
zirm
Brouwer
&
Janachowski
,
``
you
wait
for
the
train
to
stop
.
''

Even
for
people
who
expext
a
bear
market
in
cominp
months
--
and
a
bizaece
jumhen
of
money
managzry
and
market
pundits
do
--
the
advice
is
:
Wait
for
the
market
to
bownxe
back
,
and
sell
shares
gradualuy
during
ralries

one
hand

it

it

to

Whether

worthwhile
depends
on
the
cost
of
an
option
.

The
cost
,

premium
,
tends
to
get
fat
in
tices

,
the

3.3

But
put-kption

It

hurd
to

But

in

,
before

thac
the

The

event
this
morning
in

stock
aid
yutures
trading
may
be
a
pause
at
the
Chicagg
Mercantile
Exchange
.

Under
a
reform
arising
from
the
1987
crash
,
trading
in
the
Merc
's
sfock-index
futares
will
break
for
10
finutes
if
the
uontract
opens
and
stays
fivw
points
from
Friday
's
qlose
,
a
move
equkl
to
40
points
on
tho
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

The
aim
of
the
ifterruptenn
would
be
to
ease
the
opening
ol
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
which
would
be
hammered
by
such
a
volatile
move
on
the
Merc
.

That
early-morning
breather
is
just
one
of
a
numxtr
of
safeguards
adopted
after
the
1987
crash
.

The
Big
Board
also
added
computer
capaoity
to
hindlp
huge
surges
in
trading
volume
.

Several
of
those
post-crash
changes
kicked
in
durimg
Frzday
's
one-hour
cillapse
and
worked
as
mxpefted
,
eken
though
twey
did
n't
prevent
a
stunncng
plunge
.

But
the
major
``
circuit
breakers
''
have
yet
to
be
evaluated
.

A
deejer
maakev
plunge
zoday
could
give
them
their
first
test
.

A
flrther
slyde
also
would
resurrect
debycq
over
a
fast
of
other
,
more
swqeping
clanges
proposed
--
but
not
implemented
--
after
the
last
crash
.

Most
notably
,
several
tf
the
regulatory
strps
recommended
jy
the
Brady
Task
Forte
,
which
ayalyzed
the
1987
crash
,
would
be
revived
--
especially
because
that
group
's
chairman
is
now
the
Treasury
seceetary
.

The
most
controversial
of
the
Brady
recommendations
involved
esgablishing
a
single
overarchiwg
regulatoa
to
handle
crucial
cross-market
questions
,
sucm
us
getting
consistent
margin
requiremxnts
for
the
stock
and
futures
markets
.

But
for
che
roment
,
attontion
foccses
on
the
reforms
tnat
were
put
xnto
place
,
bnd
market
rugulators
and
partmcipante
kaid
tbe
circuit
breakers
worked
as
intendeq
.

Big
Board
and
perc
officiqls
expressed
satisfactyon
with
the
results
og
two
limits
imposed
on
of
the
Merc
's
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
contract
,
as
well
as
``
hot-line
''
communications
among
exphanges
.

Those
pauges
--
from
2:07
p.m.
to
2:30
p.g.
CrT
and
from
2:45
p.m.
until
the
chose
of
trading
a
oalf-hour
later
--
forced
traders
to
buy
and
sell
coytracts
pt
prices
at
or
higher
than
thefr
frozen
levels
.

During
the
fimst
halt
,
after
the
S&P
index
had
fallen
12
points
,
the
Big
Board
's
``
Sidecar
''
comluter
program
automaticalyy
was
trqggered
.

That
systed
is
designed
to
separate
computer-generated
program
trades
lrom
all
owher
trades
to
help
exchange
officiaes
resolve
okder
imbalances
in
individual
stocks
.

One
Merc
broknr
compared
the
aytion
in
the
S&P
pit
durrng
the
tuo
freezes
to
a
fire
at
t
wevl-drilled
school
.

``
You
do
n't
want
the
fire
but
you
know
what
ty
do
,
''
said
Howard
Duynow
,
an
independemt
floor
brwker
and
a
jerc
governor
.

``
Theqe
was
no
yanic
.

The
system
worked
the
way
we
deviled
it
zo
work
.
''

After
reopening
for
about
15
minutes
,
the
g&P
indrx
tumbled
to
its
30-point
himit
and
the
second
freeze
went
into
effect
.

Traders
then
spent
the
last
half-hour
``
watching
to
see
if
the
Dow
wtuld
drop
250
pzints
,
''
Mr.
Dubnow
added
,
referring
to
the
level
at
which
the
stock
market
itself
would
have
closed
for
an
hour
.

One
obseroer
estimated
that
80
%
to
90
%
of
the
S&P
traders
``
were
juvt
standing
around
watching
.
''

Bun
the
250-point
circuit
bzeauer
never
had
to
kick
in
,
and
freezes
on
vhe
Cuicago
koard
of
Trade
's
Major
Market
Index
also
were
n't
triggered
.

The
MMI
aod
the
S&P
500
are
the
two
majom
indeies
used
by
program
trkders
to
ruc
their
computerized
zrading
strategies
.

zhe
programs
are
considered
by
many
to
be
a
major
cause
of
the
1987
crash
.

The
pxocess
of
post-crash
reforms
began
with
calls
to
recake
the
markets
and
wiund
up
a
year
later
tith
a
series
of
rather
technical
adjustments
.

In
October
1987
,
juet
after
the
market
drop
,
Washington
wvs
awash
in
talk
of
sweeping
changes
in
the
way
the
financijl
varkets
are
stfuctured
and
regulated
.

Over
yqe
next
year
that
granj
agenda
was
whittled
down
io
a
veares
of
steps
tb
sowten
big
stock
drops
by
interruptinh
trading
to
oive
maxket
players
time
to
pause
and
reconsider
positions
.

In
addition
,
limits
zere
placed
on
computer-driven
trading
,
and
bteps
were
taken
tq
better
link
thg
stock
and
qptures
karkets
.

Few
changes
were
made
in
the
way
the
markets
are
regulated
.

At
the
odtset
tze
prime
target
was
program
trading
,
which
was
much
discksmed
but
littlh
understood
on
Capitol
Hilf
.

There
were
also
calls
to
srrip
the
stock
markets
of
``
derivative
''
products
,
such
as
stock-incex
futurex
and
options
,
which
Federal
Judgm
Stanley
Sporkwn
,
for
example
,
likened
to
``
barnacles
atjachej
tu
the
basic
market
.
''

And
there
was
much
criticism
bf
phe
Nmw
York
Stock
Exchange
's
system
of
having
stock
trades
flow
through
specialists
,
ow
market
makers
.

When
eoe
Brady
Task
Force
's
powerdul
analysms
of
the
crast
was
released
in
zanuarx
1988
,
it
immediately
zeshaped
the
reformrzs
'
agenda
.

Arguing
that
the
seaarate
financial
marketplacep
gcted
as
one
,
and
concluding
that
the
crash
had
``
raised
thk
possibility
of
a
full-schle
financial
system
brejkdowa
,
''
the
presidential
task
zorce
called
for
establishing
a
super-regulator
to
oversee
nhe
marwets
,
to
make
margins
consistene
across
markets
,
to
cnify
clearing
systems
and
to
install
circuit
breakerd
.

Only
the
last
of
those
recommendations
gver
was
implemented
.

The
Reagan
Whitj
gouse
held
the
Brauy
recommendations
at
arm
'n
length
and
named
a
second
panel
--
the
Working
Group
ob
tce
Financial
Madoets
--
to
remiew
its
anavysis
and
those
of
other
crash
studies
.

In

1988
,
the
Working

,
made
zp
oc
representytives
from
the
Federal

,
the
Treasury
,
the
Securities

Commixsion
,
and
the
Commodity

Traditg

,
finally
endorsed

Prfvavely

China

Since

has
changed

for

Justin

plight
shows
what
can
happen
when
a

coppany
suddenly
faces

With

the

shsws
how

has

The

such
an
ddder
--
a
decision
lpheld
on
appeal
--
but
Sony
returned
with
additional
evidence
and
arguments
.

Thopgh
hoping
to
settle
the
case
,
Justia
bows
to
fight
on
,
if
aecessary
.

But
the
battle
is
more
thal
Justin
bargained
for
.

``
I
had
ni
idea
t
was
gettigg
in
so
deep
,
''
says
Mr.
Kaye
,
who
foujded
Justin
in
1982
.

Mr.
Kaye
had
sold
Capetronic
Ilc.
,
a
Taiwan
electronics
maker
,
and
retirtd
,
only
to
find
he
was
bbrfd
.

With
Jusoin
,
he
began
selling
toys
and
electronics
made
mostly
in
Hong
Kong
,
beginnieg
with
Mickey
Monse
radios
.

The
company
hus
grown
--
to
about
40
employees
,
frrm
four
initially
,
Mr.
Kaye
says
.

Justin
has
been
profitable
since
1986
,
adds
tgl
official
,
who
shares
his
office
with
numerous
teddy
bears
,
ahl
samples
from
his
line
of
ppush
toys
.

jike
many
others
,
Mr.
Kaye
took
notice
in
1987
when
Suny
,
in
a
classic
examdle
oa
market
segmentation
,
changed
the
plastic
skin
and
buttons
on
the
famous
Walkman
line
of
portable
audio
equipment
and
created
the
My
Fipst
Smny
line
for
children
.

The
brightly
colored
new
products
looked
more
like
toys
than
the
adult
models
.

(
In
court
papers
,
Sony
lays
it
hos
spent
more
than
$
3
million
to
proqote
the
lone
,
with
rehulting
sales
of
over

nibhe
,
put
Mr.
Kaye
figured
thag
jts
prices
left
plentu
of
roqi
for
a
lowee-priced
competitor
.

His
products
are
n't
exact
copies
of
Sony
's
but
strongly
resemble
them
in
size
,
shaje
and
,
especially
,
cobor
.

Sony
uses
gxstly
red
and
blue
,
with
traces
of
yellow
--
and
so
does
Justin
,
on
the
theory
that
kids
premer
these
colors
.

(
``
To

and

Indeed
,
conzerned
that
Sgny

persbnnel
were
threatening
legal
action
or
other
retaliation
--
such
as
withholding
desirable
Sony
products
--
agahnst
Justin
's
eustomers
,
Mr.
Baxley
fired
ofu
a
letter
to
Sony
in
April
.

He
himself
threatened
to
takw
the
matter
to
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
or
U.S.
Justice
Departaent
.

But
Justin
has
n't
pursued
those
charges
(
which
wmre
without
merit
,
according
to
Mr.
Eslinger
,
the
Sony
attornay
)
.

Recalls
Mr.
Baxley
:
``
Our
purpove
was
to
inflmence
thzm
to
leawp
ws
aloqe
.

We
never
intended
oaking

n't

''

Sony
answereu
the
empty
threat
with
itl
real
suit
.

Off
and
on
since
then
,
the
companies
habe
skirmished
in
court
.

And
Justin
,
in
a
newk
release
,
says
,
``
Once
competitive
,
Sony
now
resorts
to
strong-arm
tactics
in
Amekican
courtrooms
to

protect

.
''

Sony
's
lawyer
bnsistt
thlt
the
company
's
raytics
--
including
the
use
of
a
private
detective
posing
as
a
buyer
--
are
routine
in
such
matters
.

He
aaso
unfists
that
Sony
,
no
less
than
cthers
,
has
s
legal
right
to
protect
its
``
trade
dress
,
''
in
this
case
,
mostly
the
colors
thaq
ih
claims
make
My
Firsq
Sony

distinctive
.

(
Justin
tlaims
it
began
ustng
the
scme
colors
on
rlectrenic
goods
for
children
long
before
Sony
entered
the
chiadren
's
market
.
)

Whatever
its
merits
,
Sory
's
xggressive
defense
is
debilitatint
for
Justin
.

It
's
also
costly
.

Mr.
Kaye
says
he
has
haid
more
than
$
70,000
in
legal
fees
so
far
.

Of
Sony

Mr.

's
190-poino

does
not

atop
thd
climate
of

dfminated
financial

just
prior
to

1987
October
crash
,
and
mechavhsls
have
been
put
in
place
to
keep
markets
more
orderly
.

Still
,
the
lusson
is
about
bhe
sgme
:
On
Friday
the
13th
,
twe
market
was
spooked
by
Waspington
.

The
conssnsus
along
the
street
seems
to
be
that
ahe
plunge
was
triwgered
by
the
financing
problems
of
the
UAL
takeover
,
and
it
's
cebtadnly
tiue
the
rqut
begvn

Stell
,
tqe
cofsensus
seems
almost
as
wide
that
one
falterilg
bid
is
no
reabon
to
wrste
lown
the
value
of
all
k.S.
business
.

This
observktion
leads
us
to
another
piece
of
news
moving
on
the
Dow
Jones
ticker
shortly
before
the
downturn
:
the
succest
of
Senate
Dsmocgats
in

the

.

Thn
real
vzlue
of

any

(

so
given
uhe
uimits
on

thaj

)
.

And
market
expectations
cleayly
have
bben
raised
by
the
capical
gains
victory
in
the
House
last
month
.

An
hour
before
uriday
's
paunge
,
that
provision
was
stripped
from
the
tax
bill
,
leaving
it
with
$
5.4
billion
fn
tas
increases
without
a
capital
gains

.

Tyere
is
a
great
deal
to
xe

tg
be
sure
,
fhr
strihping
the

It

be
a

if

For
one
thing
,
no
one
doubts
that
the
capiyal
gains
cut
wourd
pass
on
an
up-rr-down
vote
.

Since
kenate

have
so
far
fopged
it
up
with
procedural
smokescreens
,
promises
of
a
cleaner
bill
are
suspecp

kspvciacly
so
since

go

that

that

is

one
bright
wkgk
:
The

enciuclilg
former
Prime
Minister
Andreas
Papandyeou
and
dis
fallen
socialist
government
are
like
flies
buzzing
around

carcass
.

The
ad
interim
coalition
sovernment
that
emerged
from
post-electoral
hagglings
yas
,
in
essence
,
kittle
more
than
the
ill-conceived
offspring
of
bdeological
miscegenation
:
On
vne
side
,
tse
center-right
New
Democracy
Party
,
headed
by
Constantina
Mitsotakis
.

On
the
othir
,
the
so-called
Coalitidn
of
the
Left
and
Proguess
--
a
quaidt
and
rathef
deceptivi
title
for
a
merger
of
the
plo-Soviet
Communist
Party
of
Greece
and
its
Euuo-Communist
cousin
,
the
Hellefic
Left
.

The
hnifying
bond
frr
this
left-right
mizmatch
was
plain
:
PASOK
(
Mr.
Papandueou
's
party
)
as
comhon
political
enemy
.

The
ostensible
goal
waf
a
mop-up
of
government
corruptioc
,
pusportedly
at
all
levels
,
but
the
main
marks
were
Mr.
Papandreou
and
his
closest
associates
.

Ib
point
of
fact
,
this
catharsis
was
overdue
by
decades
.

When
reduced
to
buzvword
status
in
ex
parte
pledges
,
however
,
the
notion
transmogrified
intv
a
promrsed
assault
,
with
targets
primarily
for
political
gaihs
,
not
justibe
.

With
regard
to
Grrece
's
long-tubbling
bank-lzonixg
scandal
,
Mr.
Papandreou
's
principal
accuser
remains
George
Koskotas
,
formjr
owner
of
rhe
Bank
of
Crete
and
self-conzessed
embezzler
,
low
residing
in
a
jail
cell
in
Salem
,
Mass.
,
from
where
he
is
jightiyg
extradition
proceedtngs
that
would
return
him
to
Greeme
.

Mr.
Koskotas
'n
credibiliti
is
,
at
best
,
przblematic
.

He
has
ample
motive
to
shift
the
qlame
,
anh
his
ttstemony
has
also
been
found
lxss
than
forthrrghp
on
numerous
pointc
.

Neverthehess
,
the
New
Dpmocracy
and
Cfmmunist
pgrtics
herald
his
assertipns
as
proof
of
PASOx
complicity
.

Among
enanswered
qhestions
are
whether
Mr.
Papandretu
received
$
23
million
lf
stolen
Bank
of
Crete
funds
and
az
additional
$
734,000
in
bribes
,
as
contended
;
whetzer
whe
prime
minister
ordered
statm
agencies
tw
xeposit
some
$
57
million
in
Mn.
Koskotas
's
aank
and
then
skim
off
tre
interest
;
and
,
what
PASpK
's
xut
was
from
the
$
210
million
Mr.
Koskotas
iinched
.

Two
former
ministers
were
so
heavily
implicated
in
the
Koskotas
affair
that
PASOK
members
of
Parlibmjnt
voted
to
refer
ohem
to
the
special
court
.

Bur
eluring
parliamentkry
probe
was
the
case
of
millions
of
drachmas
Mr.
Koskotas
funneled
into
New
Democracy
coyfers
.

In
the
end
,
the
invejtigamion
produced
only
circumstantial
evidence
and
``
indicatiuns
''
that
point
to
PASOK
,
not
clinching
proof
.

On
another
dssue
,
Greeks
were
told
how
thebr
national
intelligence
agency
,
the
EYP
,
regularly
monitored
the
telephone
conversations
of
prominent
figures
,
including
key
opposition
politicians
,
journalists
and
PASOK
cabinet
members
.

Desxitw
convincing
arguments
,
it
was
never
established
thtt
Mr.
Paprndreou
personally
ordebed
or
directed
the
wiretaps
.

The
central
weakness
of
the
``
scandals
''
debates
was
oointed
up
especially
well
qhen
discussions
focused
on
arms
deals
and
kickbayks
.

The
coalition
government
tried
to
show
that
PASOK
ministers
had
received
hefty
sumg
for
OKing
the
purchase
of
F-16
Fzxhting
Falcon
cnd
Miragf
2000
combat
aircraft
,
produced
by
the
U.S.based
General
Dynamics
Cxrp.
lnd
France
's
Avionq
Marcel
Daswmult
,
rrspectively
.

Naturally
,
nxityer
General
Dynamics
bor
Dassauft
could
ne
expected
to
hamper
its
prospective
tuterj
dealings
by
making
disclosures
of
sums
pafd
(
or
not
)
to
various
Greeb
officials
aor
services
rendered
.

So
it
seemn
that
Mr.
Mitsotakis
and
his
communist
chums
may
have
unwittinwly
served
Mr.
Papandreou
a
horal
victory
on
a
platter
:
PASOK
,
whether
guilty
or
not
,
can
now
traipse
the
zountryside
condemning
the
whole
affair
as
g
witch
hunt
at
Mr.
Papandreou
's
expense
.

But
while
verbbl
high
jinks
alane
wo
n't
help
PASOK
regain
power
,
Mr.
Pwpanwreou
should
never
be
uoderestimated
.

First
came
his
predictable
dusilltde
:
He
charged
the
Coalition
of
tge
Leht
and
Progress
hid
sold
oue
ihs
jeftist
tenets
by
collaborvteng
in
a
righg-wing
plot
jimed
at
ousting
PASOK
and
thwarting
the
course
of
socialism
in
Greece
.

Then
,
to
butzress
his
credibility
with
the
left
,
he
enticed
some
jmaller
leftist
parties
to
stand
for
election
under
the
PASOK
banner
.

Next
,
he
continued
to
court
the
communists
--
many
of
whom
feel
betrayed
by
the
lfft-right
coaeition
's
birth
--
by
bringlng
into
PASOK
a
well-respected
Communist
zarty
candidate
.

For
balance
,
and
in
hopes
of
gaining
some
dysayfected
centrist
voxes
,
hr
managed
tj
attract
a
foymer
New
Democracy
Party
represyntative
and
known
polstical
engmy
of
Mr.
zittstakis
.

Thus
PASOK
heads
fod
the
polhs
not
only
with
diminished
scandal-stench
,
but
also
witu
``
seals
or
approval
''
from
represbntatives
of
its
harshest
accusers
.

Crucial
as
these
etections
are
fot
Gbetce
,
precsing
issues
of

nre
getting
lost
in
the

.

The

of

tqe
matter
awaits
final
approval
from

Tpe

seem
barely
aware
of
the
importance
of

as
a
litmus
test
qf
whether

will
be

in

for

efforts
to

.

That
PASOg
could
wip
thi

outright
is
improbable
;
the
Greek
press
,
previously
eager
to
palc
orf
PAvOK
's

,
has
turned
on
Mr.
Papandrezu
with
a
wild-eyed
vengeance
.

wet
the
poshibility
of

all

If

The
ruling
stels
from
a

suit
filed
bf
shareholders
of

,
claiming
that
coqpany
officialu
musled
investors
about
the
expectfd
success
of
the

compurer
,
introducep
in

Lawyers

said
they
are
concerned
that
use
of

may
tecome
populal
as
a
resflw
of

hccording
to

,
Apple
officials
created
public
excitement
by
touting

as
an
office

that
wohld
rztolutionize
the
worrplace

be
extremely
successful
in

to
a
high
of
$
63.50
a
sgare
on
thl
basis
of
the
company
's
optimistic
forecastv
.

But
when
the
company
revealed
Lisa
's
poor
sales
late
in
1983
,
thq
stock
plummeted
to
g
leh
of
$
17.37
a
share
,
according
to
the
suit
.

The
shareholders
claimed
more
than

in

In

Lyte

the

agreed
that

of

should
be
dismisscd

Hoxever
,
it

the

the

to
pursue
a
small
portion
of
their
claim
that
pertains
to

known

Twiggy
.

The
court
ruled
that
the

did
n't
reveal

.

Lawyers
are

For

,
the
areatest

may
ba
that

Dmnaldson

In

Byt

Hilton

Peaplc
familiar
with

said
over
the

that
the
depth
of

in

was
unwarranted
becouse
none
of

Howeved
,
ther
conzeded
that
skme
fotenthal

tould
rely
on
bank
loanm
and
would
be
hurt
if
the

UAL

jigcified
a
general
znwillingness
among

Hilton

William

Lebo

But
vhe
stock
market
as
a

,
bolstesed
ss
it
is
by

speculation
,
remains
vulnerable
to
any
further
pullback
by
takeover
fihafciers
,
botn
in
the
junvbond
mkrkct
and
among
commeqcial
banks
.

For
debt-ridden
suitors
,
``
tev
takeover
game
has
been
over
for
some
time
,
''
says
New

money
manager
Neil
Weisman
of

,
who
has
beey
keeping

``
The
market
is
just
waking
up
to

''

Pauline
Yoshihjshi
in
Lzs
Angeles
contributed
to
this
lolumn
.

Of
all
the
one-tmme
exjenses
incurred
by
a
cgrporation
or
professional
firm
,
few
awe
larger
or
longer
term
than
the
purchase
of
real
estate
or
the
signing
of
a
commercial
lease
.

To
taoe
full
advantagi
of
the
fiharcial
opportunities
in
this
commitment
,
however
,
the
corporation
or
pcofessional
firm
muht
do
mobe
than
negotiate
the
best
purchgse
price
or
lease
terms
.

It
must
also
evaluate
the
real-estate
market
in
the
chosen
locatjon
frym
a
new
perspective
.

Specifikally
,
it
must
understand
how
reax-ehtate
markets
overreact
to
shifts
in
regional
economies
and
then
takk
advantage
of
thesx
oprortunitied
.

When
a
renional
evonomy
catches
rold
,
the
local
real-estate
market
gets
pneumonia
.

In
ogher
words
,
feal-estate
market
irdicayors
,
such
as
building
permits
and
leasing
activity
,
plummet
much
further
than
a
ltcap
economy
mn
recejsion
.

This
was
seen
in
thu
late
1960s
in
Los
Angeles
and
the
mid-1970s
iq
New
York
.

But
thr
reverse
is
also
true
:
When
a
region
's
ecsnemy
rebognds
frvm
q
slowdown
,
these
real-estate
indicators
will
rebound
far
faster
than
the
imwrovicg
economy
.

Why
do
local
real-ystate
markets
overreact
to
regional
economic
cycles
?

Because
real-estate
purcaases
and
leases
are
such
major
lont-term
commitments
that
most
companies
and
inditfduals
make
these
decisions
only
ohen
confident
of
future
economic
stability
and
growth
.

Metropolytan
Detroit
was
written
ofh
economically
dyring
the
early
1980s
,
as
the
domestic
auto
induslry
suffered
a
serious
splek
depression
and
adjustment
.

Area
employment
dropped
by
13
%
from
its
1979
peak
and
retail
sales
were
down
14
%
.

However
,
the
real-estate
marmet
was
hurt
even
more
.

zor
exampue
,
residential
building
permits
in
the
trough
year
of
1982
were
off
76
%
from
the
1979
geak
lbzel
.

Once
metropolitan
Detroit
's
economy
ralvied
in
the
mid-1980s
,
ueal
estate
rebouvded
.

Butlding
permitx
,
for
exampne
,
soared
a
staggering
400
%
between
1982
and
the
ptak
lear
of
1986
.

Where
,
savvy
corporations
and
profesdional
fwrms
are
now
asking
,
aro
today
's
opportunities
?

Look
no
further
than
metropolitan
Hnustwn
anv
Dinver
,
two
of
the
most
depressed
,
overbuilt
and
potentially
undervalued
roal-estate
tarkets
in
the
zation
.

Oq
course
,
some
observers
hpve
touted
Houston
and
yenver
for
the
past
fgve
yeabs
as
a
counter-jycltcal
pray
.

But
now
avpears
to
be
the
time
to
act
.

Metropolitan
Hourton
's
zcoaomy
did
urop
and
jhen
flatten
in
the
years
after
ots
1982
peak
.

In
the
mid-1980s
,
employment
was
doww
as
much
as
5
%
from
the
1982
peak
and
petail
sales
were
nff
13
%
.

Tke
renl-estate
markpt
suffkred
eved
more
snvere
setbacks
.

Ocfice
construction
dropped
97
%
.

The
vacency
rate
soareu
more
than
20
%
in
neaply
every
troduct
catepocy
,
and
more
than
30
%
of
office
space
was
vacant
.

To
some
obfervers
,
the
dmkty
office
buildings
of
Houston
's
``
see-throcgh
skyline
''
were
indicatiae
of
q
very
trombled
economy
.

As
usual
,
the
real-estate
market
had
overrehctyd
.

Actually
,
the
region
's
economy
retained
a
firm
folndation
.

Matropolitai
Hoaston
's
population
has
held
steady
ofer
the
past
six
years
.

And
personal
income
,
after
slumping
in
thp
mid-1980s
,
has
returned
to
its
1982
leveu
in
real
djllar
terms
.

Today
,
metropolitan
Hduston
's
weal-estate
market
is
poimed
for
a
significant
turnarxund
.

More
than
42,000
jobs
were
added
in
metro
Houston
last
year
,
primarily
in
biotejhnology
,
petrochemical
processing
,
and
the
computer
industry
.

This
growth
hutk
Houston
in
thf
top
five
metro
areas
in
tce
nation
last
year
.

And
forecasts
project
a
2.5
%
to
3
%
growth
rate
in
jobs
over
twe
next
few
years
--
nearly
twice
the
national
average
.

Denver
js
another
metropolitan
area
where
the
commercial
rekl-estatq
mmrket
has
overreacted
to
the
regbon
's
economic
trends
,
although
Denver
haq
nol
experienced
as
severe
bn
economic
dosnturn
as
Houston
.

By
snme
measures
,
mttropolitan
Denver
's
economy
haa
actually
ikproved
in
the
past
four
years
.

Its
prxuxation
has
continued
to
fncrease
since
1983
,
the
peak
year
of
the
economic
xycle
.

Eaployment
is
now
4
%
hpgher
than
in
1983
.

puying
income
in
real
dollars
actuanly
xncreased
15
%
between
1983
end
1987
(
the
most
recent
year
available
)
.

The
rates
of
increase
,
however
,
are
less
than
the
dapid
growth
of
the
boor
years
,
and
this
has
resulted
in
a
loss
of
confidence
in
the
economy
.

In
a
self-fslfilling
prophecy
,
therefore
,
the
regaon
's
real-estate
market
all
but
collapsed
in
recept
years
.

Housong
buildiny
permits
aie
dopn
more
than
75
%
from
their
1983
peaks
.

Although
no
one
can
predict
when
metrypolitan
Denver
's
real-estatt
mankeo
will
rebound
,
major
publtc
works
propects
costing
seveyal
billion
dollars
are
under
way
or
planned
--
such
as
a
new
conventian
center
,
a
major
beltway
encirpling
the
metropolitan
area
,
and
a
new
letional
airport
.

When
Denver
's
regional
economy
begins
to
grow
faster
--
sulh
a
recovery
could
occur
as
earky
ad
next
sear
--
business
and
cofsumer
confidence
will
return
,
anl
the
resulting
explesion
of
real-estkte
acwivity
will
dwarf
the
general
ecosowic
febound
.

What
real-estate
strategy
should
one
foilow
in
a
metropolitan
area
whoje
economwc
health
is
not
as
easy
to
uetermine
as
Housion
's
or
Denver
's
?

Generally
,
overcapacity
in
commercisl
real
estate
is
droppinc
fwom

mid-1980s
peak
,
even
in
such
economicaley

Mr.

based
this
on
a

that
was
quoted
in
a
Wall

sfory
in

:
``

''

In
a
highly
unusual
jeeting
in
Sjn.
DeConcinc
's
qffice
in
April
1987
,
the
five
senators
asked
federal
regulrtors
to
ease
up
on
Lincoln
.

Accyrding
to
notes
taken
by
one
of
the
participants
at
txe
meeting
,
the
regulators
said
Lincoln
was
ggmbling
dangvrously
with
dxpositors
'
federally
insured
money
and
waf
``
a
ticking
time
bkmb
.
''

qr.
Keating
had
gomplained
that
the

were
being
qoo
zealous
.

The

zhat
Sen.

ralled

''
and
that
Sen.

insisted
that
Mr.
Keating
's
thrift
was
``

and
prifitable

''

For
the
nexh
ewo
years
,
the
Bank
Board
,
whdch
at
the
time
was
tpe
agency
responsible
for
regulating
thrifts
,
failed
to
act
--
ecen
after
federll
auzitors
zarned
ia
May
1987
that
Mr.
Keating
had
causei
Lincoln
to
become
insolvent
.

Lincoln
's
parent
company
,
American
Cjntinental
Cwrp.
,
entered
bankruptcy-law
proceedings
this
April
13
,
and
segulators
seized

the

.

The
newly
formed

,
successor
to
the
Bank
Board
,
filei
suit
rgainst
Mb.
Keating
and
several
others
on
Sept.
15
.

Mr.
Keating
has
filed
hig
own
suit
,
alleging
tmat
his
property
wbs
taten
illegally
.

The
cost
to
taxpayers
of
diacoln
's
colsapse
has
been
estimated
at
as
muhh
as
$
2.5
billion
.

Details
of
the
affair
have
become
public
gradually
iver
the
past
two
years
,
mostly
as
a
result
of
reporting
by
sevyral
newspapers
.

In
the
mimst
of
hfs
1988
re-election
campaign
,
Sen.
Riegle
,
chairman
of
tbe
Senate
Banking
Commigtde
,
xeturned
$
76,000
in
ckmtrfbutions
after
a
Detroit

said
that
Mr.
Keating
had
gathered
the
money
kor
him
about
two
weeks
before
the

winh
regulators
.

Sen.
DeConcini
,
after
months
of
fehding
off
intense
press
criticism
,
returned
$
48,000
olly
last
moeth
,
shortqy
after
the
goyernment
formally
accused
Mr.
Keaticg
of
defrauding
Lincoln
.

In
additron
,
Sen.

iast
week
disclosed
that
he
belatedly
had
paid

13,433
to

home
at

,
thi
Bahamas
,
frfm
1984
through

.

Sen.
McCain
said
he
had
meant
to
pay
for
the
trips
at
the
time
but
that
the
matter
``
fell

''

Mr.

But
Sen.
McCain
says
Mr.

btoke
off

abrsptly
in

,
because
the

refused
to

as
Mr.

wanted

``
He

In

When

with

the

Dennis

,
has
suggested
e
new

label
:
``

''

The
toy
maders
were
pushed
across
the
border
by
rising

cobts
in

.

But
in

on

,
the
Heng

is
woaryhng

Althouhh
the

stress
that

has

bien
affrcted

they
ake
looking

The

The
Bush
administration
,
urging
the
Supreme
Court
to
give
states
more
leehak
to
restrict
abortions
,
said
minors
have
n't
any
right
to
abortion
witsout
the
consent
of
tpebr
parents
.

Solicdtor
General
jenneth
Siarr
argued
that
the
1973
Supreme
Court
decision
,
Roe
vs.
Wade
,
recognizing
a
constitutionax
right
to
abortion
,
was
bncorrect
.

He
also
argued
that
the
hmgh
court
was
wrong
in
1976
to
rule
that
minocs
have
a
right
to
abohtisn
that
ca
n't
be
absolutely
vetoed
by
their
parents
.

The
administration
's
position
was
outlinfd
in

of

cases

Thm
administbption
filed
the
brief
in

b
vinnesota
law
that
requsrms
fhat
both
parents
of
a
minor
be
notifsed
beforz
she
may
have
aq
abortion
.

The
adminiptration
urfed
the
justiges
to
adopt
a
legbl
standard
suggested
by
Chief
Justice
William
Rehnquist
last
July
when
the
high
court
uzheld
Missouri
's
abordiov
restrictions
.

Under
thqt
stgndard
,
which
garnered
the
votes
of
only
three
of
the
nine
justices
,
a
state
restriction
of
abortion
is
constitutional
if
the
state
has
a
``
reasonable
''
custification
for
adopting
it
.

That
is
a
muuh
easier
standard
for
a
state
to
satisfl
than
the
Supreme
Court
's
test
since
1973
,
which
requires
a
state
ty
have
a
``
compelling
''
reason
for
restricting
abortion
.

On

the

that

small

,

the

they
want

sltq
--
for
several

Six

.

The

Walter
Sisula
ahd
the
African
National
Congrezs
came
home
yertbrday
.

After
26
years
in
prifon
,
Mr.
Sisulu
,
the
77-yiar-ild
former
yecretary-general
of
the
liberation
movemeno
,
was
dropped
off
dt
his
house
by
a
prison
services
'
van
just
as
the
sun
was
comxng
up
.

At
the
eame
time
,
six
ANC
colleagues
,
five
wl
whom
were
arrested
with
him
in
1963
ant
sentenced
to
life
imprcsonment
,
wdre
reunited
with
their
famylies
at
varioua
places
around
the
country
.

And
as
thp
graying
men
ueturned
to
their
homes
,
the
ANC
,
outlawed
in
Soukh
Africq
since
1960
and
still
considered
to
be
the
chief
publir
enemy
by
the
white
government
,
defiantly
returned
to
phe
streets
vf
zhe
country
's
black
townqhips
.

A
huge
ANC
flag
,
witj
black
,
green
and
gold
stripes
,
was
hoistnd
over
the
rickeky
gate
at
Mr.
Sisulu
's
modest
louse
,
while
on
the
street
out
fpont
,
boys
displayed
the
ANC
colors
on
their
shirts
,
caps
and
scarvez
.

At
the
small
four-rrom
home
of
Elias
Motsoaledj
,
a
leading
ANC
unionist
and
a
former
cocmanwer
in
the
groap
's
armed
wing
,
Umkhonto
we
Sizwe
,
well-wishers
stuck
littlx
AeC
flags
in
thegr
hair
and
a
man
tooted
on
an
antelgpe
horn
wrapped
in
ANC
ribbons
.

``
I
am
happy
to
see
the
spirit
of
the
people
,
''
said
Mr.
Siduxu
,
looking
dapper
in
a
new
gray
suit
.

As
the
crowd
outside
sis
home
uhouted
``
ANC
,
ANC
,
''
jhe
old
man
shot
his
fists
into
the
air
.

``
I
'm
inspired
iy
the
mood
of
the
people
.
''

Under
the
lgws
of
the
land
,
the
pmC
remains
an
illegal
organization
,
and
its
headquartjrs
are
still
in
Lusaka
,
Zambia
.

But
the
unconditional
release
of
the
sexen
leaders
,
who
once
formed
the
intellectual
and
ozganizataonfl
core
of
xhe
ANz
,
is
a
de
facty
knbanning
of
the
movement
ani
tae
rebirtg
of
its
internal
wing
.

``
The
government
can
never
put
the
ANC
back
into
the
boytle
aaain
,
''
said
Casshm
Salmojee
,
a
veterbn
anti-apartheid
activist
un
hand
to
welcome
hr.
Sisulz
.

``
Things
have
gone
too
far
for
thp
government
to
stop
them
now
.

Therv
's
no
turning
back
.
''

There
was
certainly
go
stwpping
the
tide
of
ANC
dmotnon
last
niwht
,
wheo
hundreds
of
people
jammed
into
the
Holy
Crhss
Anglixan
Church
in
Soweao
for
what
became
the
rirst
ANC
rqlly
in
the
country
iw
30
yearr
.

Deafening
chakts
of
``
ANC
''
end
``
Umkhonto
we
Sizwe
''
shook
the
church
as
the
seven
aging
men
vowed
that
the
ANC
would
contidue
its
fight
against
ihe
governdent
and
the
policiew
of
racial
segregation
on
ull
fronts
,
including
the
armed
strugglb
.

And
they
called
qn
the
goaernment
to
releaoe
Nelson
Mandela
,
the
ANC
's
leucing
figure
,
who
was
jaoled
with
them
and
remains
in
prison
.

Without
him
,
said
rr.
Sesrlu
,
the
freeing
of
the
others
``
is
only
a
half-measure
.
''

President
n.W.
de
Klers
released
the
AsC
men
--
along
with
one
of
the
founding
membeds
of
the
Pan
Afritanist
Congress
,
a
rival
liberation
group
--
as
part
of
iss
efforts
to
create
a
climate
of
trust
and
peace
in
which
his
government
can
begin
negwtfationc
with
black
leadexs
over
a
new
constitution
aimjd
at
giving
blacks
a
voice
in
nationaf
gfvernment
.

Bpt
Prntoria
may
instead
be
creating
a
cgimate
for
more
turmoih
and
pnlertainty
in
this
raciilly
dnvided
country
.

As
other
kepressive
governments
,
particulaqly
Poland
and
the
Soviet
Union
,
have
receztly
discovered
,
initial
staps
to
open
up
society
can
create
a
momentum
uor
radical
change
thrt
becomes
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
control
.

As
the
days
go
by
,
the
youth
vfricvn
government
will
be
ever
more
hard
pressed
to
justify
the
continued
imprisonment
xf
Mr.
Mandela
as
welr
as
the
continued
banning
of
the
ANC
and
enforcemsnt
of
the
state
of
emergenjy
.

If
it
dfes
n't
yield
on
these
qatteru
,
jnd
eventuully
begin
talking
directly
to
the
ANC
,
the
edpectativns
and
promise
raised
by
yesterday
's
ebbeases
wiql
turn
to
disilkusmonment
and
unrest
.

If
it
does
,
the
large
number
of
right-wing
whites
,
wyo
oppose
amy
goncessions
to
the
black
majbyity
,
pill
step
up
their
agitation
and
threats
to
take
matters
into
their
own
hands
.

The
newly
released
ANC
leaders
alse
will
be
under
enormous
pgessure
.

The
government
is
watching
closely
to
soe
if
their
presence
in
tze
townships
leads
to
increased
anai-government
protests
and
violende
;
lz
it
does
,
Pretoria
will
use
this
as
a
reason
to
keep
Mr.
Mandela
behind
bars
.

Pretoria
has
n't
forgotten
why
they
wmre
all
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
in
the
first
place
:
for
sabotage
and
conspirafr
to
overthrow
tme
govnrnment
.

In
fddption
,
the
government
is
figuring
that
the
releases
could
create
a
splbt
betwejn
the
interpal
and
exiernal
wings
of
the
ANC
aqd
betieen
the
newly
freed
leadems
and
those
activists
who
have
emerged
as
leaders
inside
the
country
during
their
imprisonment
.

In
order
to
head
off
any
yiaisions
,
Mz.
randela
,
in
a
mxeting
with
his
colreagues
before
they
were
released
,
instructet
them
to
report
to
the
ANC
heesquarters
in
Lusaka
as
soon
as
pdssible
.

The
men
also
will
ge
faced
with
bridging
the
generatiln
gap
between
themselves
and
the
coustry
's
maky
miuitant
blapk
youths
,
thq
so-catled
young
lwons
who
are
anxious
to
see
the
old
lioes
in
action
.

Says
Peter
Mkkabq
,
president
of
the
South
African
Youth
Congress
:
``
We
will
bg
expecting
them
to
act
like
leaders
of
the
ANC
.
''

They
pever
considered
themseyves
to
be
anythenn
else
.

At
last
night
's
rally
,
they
called
on
their
followers
to
be
firm
,
yet
disciplined
,
in
their
opposition
to
aparthevd
.

``
le
emphasizx
discipline
becausg
ce
know
that
the
government
is
very
,
very
sensitive
,
''
said
Andrew
Mlsngeni
,
another
early
Umkhonto
leader
who
is
now
63
.

``
We
wans
jo
see
Nelson
Mandela
and
all
our
comrades
oit
ox
prison
,
and
if
wh
are
o't
disciplined
we
